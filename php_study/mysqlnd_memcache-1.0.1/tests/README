These test are based on the same enironment variables
like other MySQL tests. There two new optional settings:
    MYSQL_TEST_MEMCACHE_HOST and MYSQL_TEST_MEMCACHE_PORT
to set memcache configuration. By default memcache will connect
to the MySQL host using port 11211.

These tests also override gloal configuration tables in the
innodb_memcache databse. If you need your data their make a
backup. To confirm you're aware of this set
    MYSQLND_MEMCACHE_I_KNOW_WHAT_I_DO
in your enironment before running tests.
