-------------------cpp_redis 0.2

This version of cpp_redis supports Redis 1.3.10 interface , including support for pipelining, pub/sub and multi/exec.

cpp_redis has 2 header-only dependencies:
asio 1.4.1  - http://think-async.com/      (asio, NOT boost-asio!)
boost 1.42  - http://www.boost.org/

Currently there is no tutorial or documentation for this project - consider cpp_redis_tests.h as the main starting point for guidance.

The code was tested on Linux (Ubuntu), MacOSX (Snow Leopard) and Windows 7 ( doesn't require Cygwin!)

To compile the testing client on Linux for example:
g++ -O2  -I[PATH2ASIO]//asio-1.4.1/include  -I[PATH2BOOST]/boost_1_42_0  -lpthread client.cpp -o cpp_redis



-----------------cpp_redis 0.3
added support for SETEX and ZINTER (missing from 0.2 by mistake)
